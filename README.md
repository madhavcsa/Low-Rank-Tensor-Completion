# A Dual Framework for Trace Norm Regularized Low-rank Tensor Completion

This package contains a MATLAB implementation of the algorithm presented in the report 
"A Dual Framework for Trace Norm Regularized Low-rank Tensor Completion" by Madhav Nimishakavi, Pratik Jawanpuria, and Bamdev Mishra; NeurIPS, 2018.

For queries and other related issues, please contact Pratik Jawanpuria (<pratik.iitb@gmail.com>) or Bamdev Mishra (<bamdevm@gmail.com>). 


## Installation:

1) Run run_me_first.m (needed every session).
2) Run compile_mex_c_files.m (needed to be done only once).
3) Run test_Ribeira.m. There are plots at the end. 

The proposed files are under the folder 'proposed'.



## Disclaimer:

- All files are written by the authors except
    - certain initial mex files were obtained from the works of Nicolas Boumal (<nicolasboumal@gmail.com>) and (<michael.steinlechner@epfl.ch>).

- Manopt is downloaded from http://manopt.org.
